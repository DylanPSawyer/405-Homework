<h2>The HTML Elements I Know</h2>
<ul id="elements-list">

          <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script" target="_blank">MDN Script Element</a></li>
          <li>Display: It's content won't be displyed, So I guess "display:none"</li>
          <li>Attributes:
            <ul>
                <li>async: This is a Boolean attribute indicating that the browser should, if possible, execute the script asynchronously</li>
                <li>src: This attribute specifies the URI of an external script; this can be used as an alternative to embedding a script directly within a document.</li>
                <li>defer: This Boolean attribute is set to indicate to a browser that the script is meant to be executed after the document has been parsed, but before firing DOMContentLoaded.</li>

          <li>Attributes:
            <ul>
              <li>type: This attribute defines the styling language as a MIME type (charset should not be specified). This attribute is optional and defaults to text/css if it is not specified — there is very little reason to include this in modern web documents.</li>
              <li>media: This attribute defines which media the style should be applied to. Its value is a media query, which defaults to all if the attribute is missing.</li>
              <li>title: This attribute specifies alternative style sheet sets.</li>

             <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Element" target="_blank">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Element</a><br/>: An element is a part of a webpage. In XML and HTML, an element may contain a data item or a chunk of text or an image, or perhaps nothing. A typical element includes an opening tag with some attributes, enclosed text content, and a closing tag</li>

The name of an HTML element is the name used in angle brackets such as &lt;p&gt; for paragraph.  Note that the end tag's name is preceded by a slash character, &lt;/p&gt;, and that in empty elements the end tag is neither required nor allowed. If attributes are not mentioned, default values are used in each case. </li>

For example, &lt;p&gt; is by default a block-level element, whereas &lt;a&gt; is an inline element — you can put several links next to one another in your HTML source and they will sit on the same line as one another in the rendered output.</li>

Its sole purpose is to prevent a browser from switching into so-called “quirks mode” when rendering a document; that is, the "&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;" doctype ensures that the browser makes a best-effort attempt at following the relevant specifications, rather than using a different rendering mode that is incompatible with some specifications.</li>

  <h2 >Reflection</h2>

  <p>
    My experience during the last three weeks has been positive. I enjoyed missing the first day of class. The next two weeks served largley as review, however several of the points mentioned in the lectures have been informative allowing me to learn more about concepts I m already familiar with. 
    This document, while somewhat tedious really reinforced my understanding of lists. I also learned the name of the anchor element, which I had always just called the "a". This renforcement will certainly help my avoid minor embrassments at work.
  </p>
  <p>
    During the two days of in class work I have had the oppurtunity to help my fellow students. This was an awesome oppurtuity for me as it allowed me to practice my teaching skills.
    It also always makes you feel good to help people. Despite already knowing the vast majority of course content I look forward the the rest of the semester and any tidbits or perhaps even major concepts I have missed along the way. Overall, the first three weeks have been great.
